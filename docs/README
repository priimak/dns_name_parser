	Class su.netdb.parser.Parser provides parsing used in whois, but can 
be used anywere else.
	File SETTINS under top level directory provides common settings 
used during compilation. Like location of java, javac, javadoc etc. They all 
can be overriden by shell variables, see file SETTINGS itself. In order to 
compile and use this class you will need extra package which provides perl 
like regular expressions, from http://jakarta.apache.org/oro , the package 
used during develpment was jakarta-oro-2.0.1.tar.gz but you can try newer as 
well. You can set shell variable NETDB_ORO, which is a full path to 
jakarta-oro-x.0.x.jar. Result of compilation is file parser.jar under top level
directory and a test.class which provides test of compiled parser. There is 
also an executabe file 'test' which is used to run test. You may examine 
test.java to see example of using Parser. 
	You can generate javadoc documenation by runing 'make docs'. 
'make realclean' will remove all compiled stuff including javadoc docs.
