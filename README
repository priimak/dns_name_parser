        This package is a part of netdb/whois suite. It's primary usage is to
        be used as a library, providing parsing employed in Stanford's whois
        implementation. See more detailed info in docs/README

        Make Requirements:

                j2sdk (java1.3 or higher)
                Jakarta ORO (jakarta.apache.org/oro) regex package.

        Make:

                make    - to make parser.jar ( parser libary itself ),
                        test.class and test ( shell script ) - these are
                        used for testing parser. Run test shell script to
                        see what happens.
                make docs       - to create javadoc style docs under docs/
                make dist       - to create source distribution in a file
                        parser.src.`cat VERSION`.tar.gz where VERSION is
                        a file under top level direcrory.
                make clean      - to clean results of 'make', but not docs/ !
                make realclean  - will clean everything including docs
                        generated with 'make docs'

        Installation:

                Place generated parser.jar in whatever place you want it,
                note that default location of this file assumed for making
                whois is /usr/local/netdb-parser netdb in a directory name
                becouse it is a part of netdb project.
